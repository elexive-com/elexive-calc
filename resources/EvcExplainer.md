> **AI Keywords**: EVC, elastic value credits, pricing, value model, education, modal

## Overview

The EvcExplainer component provides educational content explaining the Elastic Value Credit (EVC) system used throughout the Elexive Solution Builder. It serves as an educational modal that helps users understand the value-based pricing approach, supporting the customer's learning journey and building confidence in the calculator's pricing methodology.

> **Note:** This component is part of the [Elexive Solution Builder](./CalculatorApp.md) and adheres to the [Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md).

## Component-Specific Features

1. **Layered Educational Framework**
   - Implements progressive disclosure of EVC concepts from basic to advanced
   - Presents clear definitions with supporting visual explanations
   - Uses business-friendly language with appropriate technical depth
   - Creates conceptual connections between abstract pricing and tangible value

2. **Value Calculation Visualization**
   - Illustrates the mathematical relationship between resources and value credits
   - Shows how different factors affect EVC efficiency and production
   - Provides interactive elements to explore different scenarios
   - Implements appropriate data visualization for numeric concepts

3. **Resource Optimization Education**
   - Explains different resource allocation strategies and their efficiency impacts
   - Illustrates the cost of context-switching through visual comparisons
   - Provides best practices for optimizing resource allocation
   - Creates practical connections to the user's specific configuration

4. **Contextual Example Integration**
   - Shows the user's current EVC production capacity and efficiency
   - Relates EVC concepts to their selected modules and configuration
   - Provides real-time calculations based on their specific choices
   - Creates tangible examples relevant to their transformation context
