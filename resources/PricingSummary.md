# PricingSummary Component

## Overview

The PricingSummary component serves as the financial dashboard of the Elexive Calculator application. It presents a comprehensive breakdown of pricing, resource allocation, and service configuration details based on the user's selections throughout the calculator, representing a critical element in the "Value Validation" phase of the customer journey.

> **Note:** This component adheres to the [Elexive Calculator Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md) for visual design, interaction patterns, and customer journey integration.

## Component-Specific Design Decisions

   - Implements supporting metrics (EVCs, price per EVC) with appropriate visual weight
   - Creates clear visual distinction between different pricing components
   - Uses consistent formatting for all financial figures

2. **Calculation Transparency** - The pricing formula explanation:
   - Provides clear breakdown of how prices are calculated
   - Uses appropriate visual organization to show mathematical relationships
   - Implements consistent terminology with educational components
   - Creates appropriate business context for technical pricing concepts

### Module Selection Visualization

The selected modules display implements a thoughtful organization:

1. **Module Grid** - The selection overview:
   - Organizes modules into a scannable grid layout
   - Maintains consistent visual treatment for all module entries
   - Uses pillar-based color coding for strategic context
   - Creates appropriate information density for comprehensive overview

2. **Engagement Model Indicators** - The variant visualization:
   - Clearly distinguishes between Insight Primer and Integrated Execution
   - Uses consistent iconography from the ModuleSelector

   - Using the established color system for financial information
   - Ensuring pricing elements have consistent visual treatment
   - Applying coherent typographic hierarchy throughout the interface

2. **Information Hierarchy** - Presents information in a logical order of importance:
   - Total pricing figures as primary focal points
   - EVC metrics and resource allocation as secondary elements
   - Detailed calculation breakdowns as tertiary information
   - Supporting details provided in a logical progression

3. **Financial Clarity** - Creates transparent understanding of pricing:
   - Presenting clear, unambiguous price figures
   - Explaining each factor that influences the final price
   - Using business-friendly language for financial concepts
   - Providing appropriate context for all pricing components

4. **Business Outcome Focus** - Connects financial investment to value:
   - Relating pricing to transformation outcomes
   - Framing costs in terms of business value
   - Creating clear connections between modules and their contributions
   - Emphasizing the relationship between investment and transformation speed
