This component provides a powerful filtering system with advanced search capabilities to help users find modules that match their specific requirements.

> **Note:** This component adheres to the [Elexive Calculator Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md) for visual design, interaction patterns, and customer journey integration.

## Strategic Purpose

The Module Explorer addresses several key customer pain points identified in our research:

1. **Comprehensive Discovery**: By providing a complete view of all available consulting modules
2. **Efficient Filtering**: Through multi-dimensional search and filter capabilities
3. **Consistent Presentation**: With standardized module cards for easy comparison
4. **Self-Guided Exploration**: With tools for saving and organizing modules of interest

## Component-Specific Design Decisions

### Module Card Design

The module cards represent a key UX decision point, balancing several competing needs:

1. **Card Headers** - The colored header area of each module card:
   - Uses pillar-specific colors to provide visual categorization
   - Prominently displays the pillar name to maintain context
   - Includes the pillar icon for additional visual reinforcement
   - Positions the category badge within the header but visually distinct

2. **Content Layout** - The card's main content area:
   - Places the module name in prominent position with adequate typographic weight
   - Limits the module heading to 3 lines with ellipsis to maintain card height consistency
   - Uses subtle typographic distinction between name (heading) and description (body text)
   - Includes sufficient white space to improve readability while maintaining density

3. **Variant Badges** - The module variant indicators:
   - Use distinctive color coding (blue for Insight Primer, green for Implementation Accelerator)
   - Include appropriate iconography (lightbulb for insight, rocket for implementation)
   - Maintain consistent positioning at the bottom of the content area
   - Have compact but readable design to accommodate multiple variants

4. **Action Area** - The card footer:
   - Creates visual separation from content through subtle background color change
   - Balances primary action (view details) with secondary action (save/bookmark)
   - Uses consistent interactive elements that match the broader application
   - Provides clear hover/focus states for all interactive elements

### Search and Filter System

The search and filter interface was designed with specific UX considerations:

1. **Expandable Design** - The filter panel:
   - Remains collapsed by default to minimize initial visual complexity
   - Expands smoothly with animation when needed
   - Provides clear visual feedback on applied filters
   - Offers simple reset options to clear all filters

2. **Multi-Dimensional Filtering** - The filter options:
   - Allow filtering by pillar, category, and variant type
   - Provide clear labeling and consistent dropdown interfaces
   - Support combining multiple filter criteria
   - Update results immediately as filters change

3. **Search Integration** - The search functionality:
   - Features prominent placement with clear iconography
   - Searches across module names, descriptions, and headings
   - Provides immediate feedback on search results
   - Works in conjunction with the applied filters

4. **Results Feedback** - The results display:
   - Shows count of matching modules
   - Provides helpful empty states when no modules match
   - Maintains consistent grid layout for results
   - Offers clear option to reset filters when no results are found

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

The interface implements progressive disclosure through:

1. **Filtering Panel** - The expandable filtering interface:
   - Remains collapsed by default to reduce initial visual complexity
   - Expands smoothly with animation to show available filtering options
   - Groups related filters together (pillar, category, variant)
   - Provides immediate visual feedback when filters are applied

2. **Detail View Transition** - The module detail expansion:
   - Shifts from card view to comprehensive detail view through clear modal transition
   - Organizes detailed information into logical sections with visual separation
   - Uses typography and spacing to create scannable information hierarchy
   - Includes export and sharing options only at the detailed level

3. **Saved Modules Management** - The bookmarking system:
   - Shows simple save/unsave toggle on cards for minimal complexity
   - Reveals additional management options only when saved modules exist
   - Uses familiar bookmark iconography for immediate recognition
   - Provides count indicator to show how many modules have been saved
