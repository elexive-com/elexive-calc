## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Architecture

The application uses a custom hook-based state management approach:

```jsx
// Centralized state management hook
const calculator = useCalculator();

// Access state values
const { 
  intent, 
  productionCapacity,
  resourceAllocation,
  selectedModules,
  // ... other state values
} = calculator;

// Update state via provided functions
calculator.setIntent('Growth Strategy');
calculator.toggleModule('module-id');
calculator.setProductionCapacity('high');
```

The state includes several key categories:

1. **Configuration State**: User selections like intent, modules, capacity
2. **Derived State**: Calculated values based on selections
3. **UI State**: Interface-specific states like expanded sections

### Navigation System

The application uses a tab-based navigation system:

```jsx
const { activeTab, setActiveTab } = useTabContext();

// Navigation tabs
const tabs = [
  { id: 'calculator', label: 'Solution Builder' },
  { id: 'modules', label: 'Module Explorer' },
  { id: 'journey', label: 'Journey Planner' }
];

// Tab switching
<button onClick={() => setActiveTab('modules')}>
  Go to Module Explorer
</button>
```

### Responsive Design Implementation

The application implements a responsive design approach using:

1. **Tailwind CSS**: For consistent styling and responsive utility classes
2. **Flex and Grid Layouts**: For responsive component arrangements
3. **Mobile-First Breakpoints**: Design starts with mobile and enhances for larger screens
4. **Conditional Rendering**: Different UI elements for different viewport sizes

## Design Patterns

The application implements several consistent design patterns:

1. **Expandable Sections**: Used throughout for progressive disclosure
2. **Card Components**: For consistent presentation of modules and options
3. **Two-Column Layout**: Content on left, summary on right for desktop view
4. **Stepped Process**: Clearly numbered steps with completion indicators
5. **Educational Tooltips**: Contextual help throughout the application
