## Service-First Design Mindset

The Elexive Solution Builder is not a scoping toolâ€”it is the gateway to an ongoing, modular advisory service. Every design decision should support:

- Re-engagement and persistent access
- Clarity around long-term advisory pathways
- Transparent delivery through Elastic Value Credits (EVCs)
- Momentum toward relationship-building, not just transaction completion

Our interface must reflect that this is a recurring service, not a one-off decision.

## Core Design Principles

All components within the Elexive Solution Builder adhere to these foundational design principles:

### 1. **Visual Consistency**
   - Maintain strong visual relationships between related elements
   - Use the established color system for semantic meaning
   - Ensure interface elements have consistent visual treatment
   - Apply coherent typographic hierarchy throughout the application

### 2. **Information Hierarchy**
   - Present information in a logical order of importance
   - Use size, color, and position to indicate information priority
   - Create clear visual distinction between primary, secondary, and tertiary information
   - Implement progressive disclosure for complex information through expandable sections

### 3. **Cognitive Load Management**
   - Chunk information into digestible sections
   - Limit the number of choices presented at any given moment
   - Use consistent patterns and layouts across the interface
   - Provide visual cues that guide attention to important elements
   - Support executive decision-making under time pressure
   - Increase clarity of high-impact actions during reconfiguration

### 4. **Business-Focused Language**
   - Frame all information in executive-friendly terms
   - Emphasize business outcomes rather than technical details
   - Use familiar business terminology and metrics
   - Avoid consulting jargon in favor of clear business language

### 5. **Visual Storytelling**
   - Use design elements to convey relationships and processes
   - Implement color coding to create meaningful associations
   - Apply consistent iconography to reinforce concepts
   - Create clear visual patterns that guide users through the experience

## Color System
