# ResourceAllocationSelector Component

> **Status**: Implemented  
> **Last Updated**: May 16, 2025  
> **AI Keywords**: resource allocation, efficiency, context-switching, strategy, overhead, optimization

## Overview

The ResourceAllocationSelector component enables users to determine how their EVC (Elastic Value Credit) resources are allocated across different business transformation initiatives. It offers three distinct allocation strategies (Focused, Balanced, Distributed), each with its own efficiency implications based on context-switching overhead, serving as a key element in the "Strategic Optimization" phase of the customer journey.

> **Note:** This component adheres to the [Elexive Solution Builder Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md) for visual design, interaction patterns, and customer journey integration.

> **Important:** The overhead represents additional work required due to context switching. While 100% is always the full EVC amount for the selected modules, when work is done in parallel (using Balanced or Distributed strategies), the configured overhead percentage is added on top of the module EVC totals to account for the extra effort needed to complete the work.

## Strategic Purpose

The ResourceAllocationSelector addresses several key customer needs identified in our research:

1. **Transformation Strategy Clarity**: By providing clear options for resource allocation approaches
2. **Efficiency Optimization**: By educating executives about context-switching costs in consulting services
3. **Business Priority Alignment**: By matching resource allocation strategy to organizational readiness
4. **Strategic Control**: By providing transparency into productivity trade-offs in transformation initiatives

2. **Configuration-Driven Design**
   - Uses `calculatorConfig.json` to define allocation strategies and their properties
   - Dynamically generates options based on configuration data
   - Supports extensibility for adding or modifying allocation strategies
   - Maintains consistent presentation regardless of configuration changes

3. **Efficiency Impact Calculation**
   - Calculates and displays the overhead costs of context switching
   - Shows the effective efficiency percentage for each allocation approach
   - Provides visual representation of base work vs. overhead for each strategy
   - Updates calculations in real-time as selections change

4. **Business Context Presentation**
   - Provides clear descriptions of what each allocation strategy means
   - Includes business-relevant factors for selecting each option

## Technical Implementation

### Props

- `resourceAllocation`: String representing the currently selected allocation strategy (default: 'focused')
- `setResourceAllocation`: Function to update the selected allocation strategy
- `productionCapacity`: String representing the current production capacity tier

### State Management

- `showExplainer`: Boolean controlling visibility of the detailed context switching explanation section

### Helper Functions

1. **`isRecommendedStrategy(strategy)`**
   - Determines if a strategy should be recommended based on the current production capacity
   - Returns boolean indicating recommendation status
   - Logic:
     - For pathfinder capacity, recommends focused strategy
     - For jetpack capacity, recommends balanced strategy
     - For rocket capacity, all strategies are viable so none receive special recommendation

2. **`isStrategyDisabled(strategy)`**
   - Determines if a strategy should be disabled based on production capacity constraints
   - Returns boolean indicating disabled status
   - Enforces rules about which capacity tiers can use which allocation strategies

3. **`handleAllocationSelect(key)`**
   - Handles strategy selection with validation against disabled options
   - Only allows selection of strategies that are valid for current capacity

4. **`getStrategyExample(strategy)`**
   - Provides context-specific example use cases for each strategy
   - Returns descriptive text explaining ideal use case for the strategy

5. **`getStrategyIcon(key)`**, **`getSwitchingCost(key)`**, **`getOverheadLabel(key)`**
   - Utility functions to retrieve strategy-specific UI elements and data points
   - Maintain consistent visual language and calculations

### External Dependencies

1. **Configuration Data**
   - Imports resource allocation definitions from `calculatorConfig.json`
   - Each allocation strategy contains:
     - `description`: Text label for the strategy
     - `label`: Detailed description of the allocation approach
     - `valueProposition`: Primary benefit statement
     - `switchingOverhead`: Numeric percentage of additional work required due to context switching
     - `overheadLabel`: Human-readable representation of the overhead

2. **UI Components**
   - Uses `FeatureIntroduction` component to provide contextual guidance
   - Leverages FontAwesome icons for visual representation of concepts

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Educational Approach**
   - Takes a "teach, then guide" approach to complex productivity concepts
   - Provides expandable detailed explanation that doesn't overwhelm by default
   - Uses visual aids (bar charts) to illustrate abstract productivity concepts

2. **Contextual Constraints**
   - Clearly communicates which strategies are available for the current capacity
   - Provides visual feedback for disabled options rather than hiding them completely
   - Explains the reasoning behind constraints through recommendations

3. **Decision Support**
   - Shows concrete examples of when each strategy is appropriate
   - Highlights context switching costs prominently to emphasize this key consideration
   - Uses color-coding to quickly communicate efficiency levels (green, yellow, orange)

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

1. **Default Selection**
   - Provides a default 'focused' strategy to ensure calculations remain valid
   - Prevents invalid selections by disabling incompatible options based on capacity

2. **Capacity Changes**
   - Re-evaluates strategy availability when production capacity changes
   - May auto-adjust selected strategy if current selection becomes invalid with capacity change

3. **Configuration Validation**
   - Reliably handles configuration data with fallbacks for missing properties
   - Ensures switching cost calculations always render correctly

## Performance Considerations

1. **Conditional Rendering**
   - Uses state to control visibility of detailed explanations rather than including them always
   - Implements animation for smooth transitions when expanding/collapsing sections

2. **Cached Calculations**
   - Utilizes helper functions to calculate derived values only when needed
   - Avoids redundant calculations by using component variables

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Custom Overhead Settings**
   - Allow advanced users to adjust context switching overhead percentages
   - Provide simulation tools to model different productivity scenarios

2. **Team Composition Effects**
   - Add configuration for team size and composition to refine overhead calculations
   - Account for specialized roles and their different context switching sensitivities

3. **Temporal Allocation Planning**
   - Enable planning for changes in allocation strategy over time
   - Allow for strategy shifts as projects move through different phases

4. **AI-Powered Recommendations**
   - Implement AI-based recommendation engine for optimal resource allocation
   - Account for project complexity, team expertise, and business priorities

5. **Case Study Integration**
   - Include real-world examples of successful resource allocation approaches
   - Provide industry-specific benchmarks and best practices
