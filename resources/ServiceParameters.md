# ServiceParameters Component

## Overview

The ServiceParameters component allows users to configure additional service-related settings that affect pricing, billing, and delivery options for their business transformation initiative. It provides an interface for selecting payment options and toggling various service-specific parameters, serving as a refinement mechanism in the "Strategic Optimization" phase of the customer journey.

> **Note:** This component adheres to the [Elexive Calculator Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md) for visual design, interaction patterns, and customer journey integration.

## Strategic Purpose

The ServiceParameters addresses several key customer needs identified in our research:

1. **Financial Flexibility**: By providing multiple payment options with transparent pricing implications
2. **Service Customization**: By allowing fine-tuning of delivery parameters to match business constraints
3. **Value Optimization**: By enabling adjustment of service elements to maximize ROI
4. **Control Enhancement**: By providing granular configuration options for the consulting engagement
5. **Business Relationship Management**: By offering dedicated support and service level options

## Component-Specific Design Decisions

### Payment Option Design

The payment option selectors implement a deliberate decision framework:

1. **Option Presentation** - The payment selection layout:
   - Uses clear, distinctive styling for each payment option
   - Implements obvious visual feedback for the selected option
   - Provides immediate indication of financial implications (discounts)
   - Creates appropriate context for understanding payment terms

2. **Financial Transparency** - The cost implication indicators:
   - Shows explicit discount percentages for eligible payment options
   - Uses consistent formatting for financial information
   - Provides clear visual connection between selection and pricing impact
   - Implements appropriate typography for financial figures

### Reserved EVC Option

The Reserved EVC option (formerly "Prepaid EVCs") follows a similar concept to how cloud computing resources are reserved in advance:

1. **Reserved Capacity Model**
   - Allocates Elastic Value Credits (EVC) capacity in advance for the transformation initiative
   - Provides cost efficiency through upfront commitment
   - Ensures resource availability throughout the engagement
   - Follows industry-standard approach similar to cloud computing reserved instances

2. **Business Value Proposition**
   - Offers predictable pricing for budget planning
   - Provides cost savings through discount incentives
   - Ensures capacity is guaranteed for mission-critical initiatives
   - Simplifies financial planning and approval processes

### Parameter Toggle Design

The parameter toggle controls balance several competing needs:

1. **Toggle Control Design** - The interactive elements:
   - Implements accessible toggle switches with clear state indicators
   - Uses consistent sizing and spacing for optimal usability
   - Provides appropriate visual feedback for interaction states
   - Creates clear distinction between enabled and disabled parameters

2. **Information Architecture** - The parameter organization:
   - Groups related parameters into logical categories

## Implementation Details

### Props

- `serviceParameters`: Array of parameter objects with configuration details
- `paymentOption`: String representing the currently selected payment option
- `togglePaymentOption`: Function to update the selected payment option
- `parameters`: Object containing the current state of all toggleable parameters
- `updateParameter`: Function to toggle a specific parameter's state

### External Dependencies

1. **Configuration Data**
   - Imports payment option definitions from `calculatorConfig.json`
   - Each payment option contains:
     - `name`: Display name for the payment option
     - `priceModifier`: Numeric factor applied to pricing calculations

2. **Utility Functions**
   - Uses `getDiscountLabel` from `iconUtils.js` to generate human-readable discount labels
   - Formats pricing modifiers as percentage discounts where applicable

### Rendering Logic

1. **Payment Option Section**
   - Maps through available payment options from configuration
   - Applies conditional styling to indicate the selected option
   - Provides contextual help text explaining the implications of the current selection

2. **Parameters Section**
   - Iterates through provided service parameters to create toggle controls
   - Implements binary on/off state for each parameter
   - Displays clear enabled/disabled visual states with appropriate icons

3. **Fallback Handling**
   - Implements safety check for undefined `serviceParameters` prop
   - Provides empty array fallback to ensure component doesn't break if data is missing

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Clear Financial Implications**
   - Explicitly shows discount percentages for payment options
   - Provides contextual explanation of payment terms
   - Uses consistent visual indicators for selections

2. **Informative Parameter Descriptions**
