   - Semi-transparent black background for focus
   - Flexible content container with maximum size constraints

2. **Header Section**
   - Sticky positioning to remain visible during scrolling
   - Title with descriptive icon
   - Close button with appropriate icon and hover states

3. **Content Sections**
   - Main pricing summary with key financial metrics
   - Module selection grid with variant details
   - EVC calculation explanation with formula breakdown
   - Custom parameters list with enabled status
   - Detailed price calculation breakdown
   - Call-to-action footer

### Helper Functions

1. **`getVariantDisplayName(variantType)`**
   - Converts internal variant identifiers to human-readable names
   - Returns "Insight Primer" or "Integrated Execution" based on variant type

2. **`getVariantIcon(variantType)`**
   - Returns the appropriate FontAwesome icon for each variant
   - Uses lightbulb icon for "insightPrimer" and tools icon for "integratedExecution"

### Data Processing

1. **Selected Module Processing**
   - Filters and maps the modules array to include only selected items
   - Extracts variant-specific EVC values based on user selections
   - Generates EVC range information for reference

2. **Calculation Extraction**
   - Pulls payment option details from configuration
   - Calculates totals and subtotals for display
   - Formats monetary values with appropriate localization

3. **Parameter Filtering**
   - Processes enabled parameters for display
   - Retrieves detailed information from service parameters collection
   - Formats modifier values for presentation

## User Experience Considerations
