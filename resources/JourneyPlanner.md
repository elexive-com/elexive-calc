# Journey Planner Component

## Overview

The Journey Planner component provides an immersive, visual representation of the client transformation journey, allowing executives to understand the sequential nature of business transformation and discover modules that support each phase. This standalone component transforms the traditional consulting approach by organizing services into a clear, chronological narrative that guides customers through their transformation path.

> **Note:** This component adheres to the [Elexive Calculator Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md) for visual design, interaction patterns, and journey integration.

## Strategic Purpose

The Journey Planner component addresses several key customer needs identified in our research:

1. **Sequential Understanding**: Helps executives visualize transformation as a chronological process
2. **Stage-Specific Focus**: Allows customers to focus on their current implementation stage
3. **Contextual Discovery**: Presents modules within the relevant phase of transformation
4. **Transformation Narrative**: Creates a compelling story about how transformation unfolds

## Component-Specific Design Decisions

### Journey Visualization Design

The journey visualization represents a key UX decision point, creating a guided pathway through transformation:

1. **Journey Steps** - The connected journey phase cards:
   - Use distinct color-coding for each stage (blue, amber, green, purple)
   - Include numerical indicators (1,2,3,4) to reinforce sequential nature
   - Feature stage-specific iconography for visual recognition
   - Connect with directional arrows to indicate progression
   - Apply dramatic visual state changes between active and inactive stages

2. **Active State Design** - When a journey step is selected:
   - Background color changes to the full saturation of the stage color
   - Text changes to white for maximum contrast
   - Icon colors adjust for visibility against the colored background
   - Number indicator inverts colors to maintain visibility
   - Shadow effect increases to create depth and focus

3. **Content Transition** - The module display for the selected stage:
   - Updates dynamically to show only relevant modules
   - Includes clear heading showing the active stage
   - Maintains consistent module card design across the application
   - Shows helpful empty state if no modules match filters

### Module Card Design

The module cards maintain consistency with the broader application while providing context:

1. **Card Headers**
   - Uses the same color as the module's parent pillar
   - Prominently displays the pillar name to maintain context
   - Includes the pillar icon for additional visual reinforcement
   - Positions the category badge within the header but visually distinct

2. **Content Layout**
   - Places the module name in prominent position
   - Includes concise heading text that describes the module's purpose
   - Uses consistent typography matching the application design system
   - Features sufficient white space for readability

3. **Variant Badges**
   - Uses distinctive color coding (blue for Insight Primer, green for Implementation Accelerator)
   - Includes appropriate iconography (lightbulb for insight, rocket for implementation)
   - Maintains consistent positioning at the bottom of the content area

4. **Action Area**
   - Balances primary action (view details) with secondary action (save/bookmark)
   - Creates visual separation from content through subtle background color change
   - Provides clear hover/focus states for all interactive elements

### Filter Panel Design

The filter system was designed to support focused exploration:

1. **Expandable Interface**
   - Remains collapsed by default to reduce initial visual complexity
   - Expands smoothly with animation to show available filtering options
   - Groups related filters together (pillar, category, variant)
   - Provides immediate visual feedback when filters are applied

2. **Search Integration**
   - Presents prominent search functionality for direct module finding
   - Shows clear visual indicators for active search
   - Provides feedback on the number of matching results
   - Supports immediate clearing of search terms

## Core Functionality

### Journey Navigation

The Journey Planner interface enables users to:

1. **Explore Sequential Phases**
   - Navigate through the four key transformation phases: Assess, Plan, Execute, Optimize
   - Understand the purpose and outcomes of each journey stage
   - See the relationship between stages through visual connections
   - Focus on their current implementation stage

2. **Discover Phase-Specific Modules**
   - View consulting modules relevant to the selected journey stage
   - Understand which modules are most appropriate for their current phase
   - See how modules across different pillars support the same journey stage
   - Build a stage-appropriate transformation plan

### Filtering and Search

The component includes powerful filtering capabilities:

1. **Multi-dimensional Filtering**
   - Filter modules by transformation pillar (Transformation, Strategy, Technology)
   - Narrow options by module category
   - Focus on specific module variants (Insight Primer, Implementation Accelerator)
   - Combine filters for precise module discovery

2. **Contextual Search**
   - Search within the current journey stage or across all stages
   - Find modules by name, description, or heading text
   - Receive immediate feedback on search results
   - Clear or refine search easily

### Module Interaction

Users can interact with modules through:

1. **Module Cards**
   - View summary information about each module
   - See which pillar and category the module belongs to
   - Identify available variants
   - Save modules for later reference
   - Access detailed module information

2. **Detail View**
   - Explore comprehensive module descriptions
   - Understand how the module fits within the transformation journey
   - Learn about available variants and their value propositions
   - Export module details as PDF for stakeholder alignment
   - Return easily to the journey view

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The Journey Planner is built as a self-contained React component that:

- Consumes module and journey data from centralized configuration sources
- Maintains internal state for selections and view preferences
- Implements responsive design for multi-device compatibility
- Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for advanced layout requirements
- Leverages Tailwind CSS for consistent styling

### State Management

The component manages several key state variables:

- Active journey step selection
- Filtered modules based on journey stage and other criteria
- Search and filter parameters
- Saved/bookmarked modules
- Detail view state and selected module
- UI state like expanded filters

### Data Model

The component relies on structured data for:

- Journey stages with descriptions, icons, and color mappings
- Module metadata including journey stage associations
- Pillar and category classifications
- Variant definitions

### Accessibility Considerations

The Journey Planner is built with accessibility in mind:

- Semantic HTML structure for screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- ARIA attributes for complex interactive widgets
- Sufficient color contrast for all text elements
- Focus management for interactive elements and transitions

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Engagement**

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing or extending the Journey Planner:

1. Maintain the sequential narrative of the transformation journey
2. Preserve the distinct color-coding for each journey stage
3. Ensure journey stages are clearly connected visually
4. Keep module information consistent with other application views
5. Maintain the progressive disclosure approach to information
6. Ensure responsive design works across devices
7. Prioritize accessibility for all interactive elements

## Metrics & Success Indicators

The effectiveness of the Journey Planner should be measured by:

1. Journey stage engagement (which stages are most explored)
2. Module discovery patterns (modules viewed by journey stage)
3. Time spent exploring different journey phases
4. Filter usage patterns to understand refinement needs
5. PDF exports as indicators of sharing intent
6. Progression through journey stages over time

By continuously optimizing against these metrics, the Journey Planner can become an increasingly effective tool for guiding users through their transformation process and connecting them with the most relevant consulting modules for their current stage.
