## ModuleExplorer: The Heart of the Guided Exploration Experience

### Strategic Purpose

The ModuleExplorer is a cornerstone of our customer journey, designed to address several key customer pain points:

   - Creates sharable artifacts (PDFs) that support stakeholder alignment

## Service Delivery Model & Resource Allocation

### EVC (Elastic Value Credits) Framework

The calculator implements a sophisticated resource allocation model through our EVC (Elastic Value Credits) framework:

1. **Resource Unit Definition**
   - EVC represents a standardized unit of consulting value delivery capacity
   - Each EVC encapsulates a balanced mix of expertise, time, and deliverable value
   - This abstraction allows for simplified resource allocation without sacrificing accuracy

2. **Reserved EVC Model**
   - Implements a capacity reservation approach similar to cloud computing resource models
   - Allows clients to reserve transformation capacity in advance for greater cost efficiency
   - Provides predictable pricing and guaranteed resource availability
   - Offers significant discounts for upfront commitment to transformation initiatives

3. **Flexible Allocation**
   - Enables dynamic distribution of EVCs across transformation, strategy, and technology pillars
   - Supports reallocation as business priorities shift during transformation journeys
   - Creates visual representation of resource distribution for executive understanding

4. **Tiered Volume Discount Model**
   - Implements an enterprise-grade tiered discount structure that rewards increased capacity
   - Applies discounts incrementally to EVCs above each threshold, similar to tax brackets
   - Ensures the effective discount percentage always increases with higher volumes
   - Creates natural incentives for capacity expansion without pricing cliffs
   - Visualizes volume discounts transparently in the pricing interface
   - Operates independently from, but complementary to, the Reserved EVC discount

The tiered discount model calculates pricing as follows:
   - Base EVCs (up to first threshold): Full price
   - EVCs in Tier 1 (above first threshold): First discount rate 
   - EVCs in Tier 2 (above second threshold): Second discount rate
   - EVCs in Tier 3 (above third threshold): Third discount rate
   - The resulting blended discount percentage is clearly displayed to the customer

This approach translates complex consulting resource allocation into an intuitive model that business decision-makers can easily grasp while maintaining the accuracy needed for proper transformation planning.

## Customer Journey Transformation Goals

Our implementation of this journey aims to fundamentally transform the consulting sales process by:

1. **Shifting Control**: From consultant-driven to customer-driven exploration
2. **Changing Timing**: From premature sales pressure to self-paced discovery
3. **Inverting Value Delivery**: From value after purchase to value before commitment
4. **Transforming Transparency**: From opaque pricing to clear value-based metrics
5. **Reimagining Education**: From consultant expertise hoarding to customer enablement

## Current Implementation Maturity

As of April 2025, components of the customer journey are at different stages of implementation:

- **Fully Implemented**: ModuleExplorer, CalculatorIntroduction, DetailedReportModal
- **Partially Implemented**: ModuleSelector, ServiceParameters, SummarySidebar
- **Under Development**: ProductionCapacitySelector, ResourceAllocationSelector
- **Planned**: Enhanced conversion pathways, industry-specific presets

The most mature component, ModuleExplorer, demonstrates our approach to reducing information asymmetry and complexity overwhelm while increasing customer control through visual organization, multiple navigation paradigms, and progressive disclosure of information.
