### Psychological Triggers for Conversion

   - Case study snippets at decision points provide contextual reassurance

4. **Authority Positioning**
   - Educational content establishes Elexive's thought leadership in transformation, strategy, and technology
   - Expert insights are woven into the experience rather than presented as sales messages
   - Detailed calculations demonstrate analytical rigor and domain expertise

5. **Reciprocity Triggers**
   - Calculator delivers immediate value before requesting contact information
   - Detailed downloadable content creates exchange opportunities 
   - Personalized insights generate "return-the-favor" response motivating conversion
