# Component Documentation Migration Plan

> **Last Updated**: May 16, 2025

This document outlines the plan for migrating all Elexive Solution Builder component documentation to the new streamlined format while maintaining the hierarchical documentation approach.

## Migration Goals

1. **Reduce Redundancy**: Eliminate repetitive information across component documentation
2. **Establish Clear Hierarchy**: Reinforce CalculatorApp.md as the main documentation
3. **Preserve Component Context**: Maintain detailed component-specific information
4. **Improve Maintainability**: Make documentation easier to update when components change
5. **Enhance AI Understanding**: Maintain AI-friendly structure and cross-references

## Current Status

- **CalculatorApp.md**: Created as the main application documentation
- **StreamlinedComponentTemplate.md**: Created as the reference for the new format
- **ComponentHierarchy.md**: Created to visualize component relationships
- **CalculatorIntroduction.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **ModuleSelector.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **OnboardingQuiz.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **SummarySidebar.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **ModuleExplorer.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **JourneyPlanner.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **ProductionCapacitySelector.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **ResourceAllocationSelector.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **ServiceParameters.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **DetailedReportModal.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **EvcExplainer.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **ModuleDetails.md**: Migrated to the new format
- **FeatureIntroduction.md**: Migrated to the new format

**✅ All components have been successfully migrated to the new format!**

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Component Documentation Review

For each component documentation file:
1. Review current documentation for component-specific details
2. Identify sections that duplicate information in CalculatorApp.md
3. Note cross-references and integration points

### Step 2: Create Streamlined Version

For each component documentation file:
1. Use the StreamlinedComponentTemplate.md as a base
2. Populate the Overview section with a concise description
3. Create Component-Specific Features section with unique features
4. Document Implementation Highlights that are specific to this component
5. Document Integration Points with other components
6. Update Related Components with accurate cross-references

### Step 3: Quality Control

For each migrated document:
1. Verify that no essential information has been lost
2. Ensure proper cross-references to CalculatorApp.md
3. Check that component-specific details are preserved
4. Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current implementation

## Automation Support

To assist with the migration process, consider using the following automation:

1. **Template Script**: Create a script that generates the new document structure
2. **Cross-Reference Checker**: Tool to verify cross-references between documents
3. **Content Validator**: Validates that no required sections are missing

## Completion Criteria

The migration will be considered complete when:

1. All component documentation files use the new streamlined format
2. CalculatorApp.md contains comprehensive application-level information
3. Cross-references between all documents are accurate
4. DocumentationStandardizationProgress.md is updated to reflect the new approach
5. Stakeholders have verified the documentation's accuracy and completeness

## Post-Migration Maintenance

After the migration is complete:

1. Update the documentation review process to maintain the hierarchical approach
2. Create guidelines for documenting new components
3. Establish a regular documentation review cycle
4. Train team members on the new documentation approach
