# SummarySidebar Component

## Overview

The SummarySidebar component provides a persistent, consolidated view of the user's current calculator configuration. It displays key selections, calculations, and summary information in a compact, easily scannable format that remains visible throughout the configuration process, serving as a continuous feedback mechanism across all phases of the customer journey.

> **Note:** This component adheres to the [Elexive Calculator Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md) for visual design, interaction patterns, and customer journey integration.

## Component-Specific Design Decisions

### Information Organization

The sidebar implements a deliberate information architecture:

1. **Critical Metrics** - The key business outcomes:
   - Presents price and timeline information with prominent visual treatment
   - Uses distinctive typography to emphasize the most important figures
   - Creates immediate visibility for decision-critical information
   - Implements consistent visual patterns for financial and temporal data

2. **Configuration Summary** - The selected options:
   - Organizes selections into logical, collapsible sections
   - Uses consistent iconography and visual treatment for each selection category
   - Creates scannable overviews of complex configuration choices
   - Maintains appropriate information density through progressive disclosure

3. **Call-to-Action Area** - The progression pathway:
   - Provides contextually appropriate action buttons
   - Creates visual emphasis through distinctive styling
   - Implements logical positioning at the conclusion of the summary
   - Uses action-oriented language that frames next steps in terms of value

### Expandable Section Design

The expandable sections balance several competing needs:

1. **Information Density Management** - The progressive disclosure approach:
   - Implements collapsible sections to prevent information overload
   - Uses consistent expansion/collapse indicators and behaviors
   - Provides appropriate default states based on information importance
   - Creates predictable interaction patterns for information exploration

2. **Section Visual Treatment** - The categorical design system:
   - Uses consistent header styling with appropriate iconography
   - Implements subtle background treatments to distinguish section types
   - Creates clear visual boundaries between information categories
   - Maintains cohesive visual language across all expandable sections

## Strategic Purpose

The SummarySidebar addresses several key customer needs identified in our research:

1. **Decision Visibility**: By providing persistent visualization of all selections and their implications
2. **Configuration Awareness**: By showing the cumulative impact of multiple configuration decisions
3. **Progress Reinforcement**: By displaying completed steps and remaining configuration options
4. **Value Transparency**: By continuously updating pricing and timeline calculations based on selections

## Design Principles

The SummarySidebar's design follows the key principles established throughout the calculator:

1. **Visual Consistency** - Maintains strong visual relationships with the broader application:
   - Using the established color system for pillar and category indicators
   - Ensuring summary elements have consistent visual treatment
   - Applying coherent typographic hierarchy throughout the interface

2. **Information Hierarchy** - Presents information in a logical order of importance:
   - Pricing and timeline information as primary focal points
   - Module selections and key configuration choices as secondary elements
   - Supporting details and parameters as tertiary information
   - Progressive disclosure through expandable sections for density management

3. **Persistent Awareness** - Creates continuous visibility of configuration state:
   - Maintaining fixed positioning during user navigation
   - Updating in real-time as configuration changes
   - Providing consistent visual feedback on all selection impacts
   - Creating a comprehensive overview that reinforces the holistic solution

4. **Action Integration** - Facilitates progression through the customer journey:
   - Providing contextually appropriate calls-to-action
   - Connecting exploration to validation through report generation
   - Creating clear pathways to consulting engagement
   - Enabling educational exploration through modal access points
