# OnboardingQuiz Component

## Overview

The OnboardingQuiz component serves as the initial personalization mechanism for the Elexive Calculator, helping users identify their core business priority and select an appropriate starting point. It presents pre-configured solution templates as well as a custom option, guiding users toward the most relevant calculator configuration for their needs.

> **Note:** This component adheres to the [Elexive Calculator Design Guidelines](./DesignGuidelines.md) for visual design, interaction patterns, and customer journey integration.

## Purpose

This component addresses the critical need for personalization in the calculator experience. It helps users quickly orient themselves by presenting common business scenarios and priorities, allowing them to choose a path that aligns with their specific challenges. By offering both ready-made solutions and custom options, it accommodates different user preferences while streamlining the configuration process.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Functionality

1. **Business Priority Selection**
   - Presents a set of pre-defined business intents for users to choose from
   - Distinguishes between ready-made solutions and custom configuration options
   - Provides visual feedback for the currently selected option

2. **Preset Integration**
   - Leverages pre-configured presets from calculatorPresets.json
   - Maps intent selections to appropriate preset configurations
   - Uses preset descriptions when available for consistent messaging

3. **Navigation Controls**
   - Includes a "Start Over" button to reset the calculator
   - Implements selection handlers to move users to the next step
   - Maintains consistent visual styling with the rest of the application

4. **Educational Elements**
   - Uses the FeatureIntroduction component to provide guidance
   - Explains the difference between ready-made and custom solutions
   - Sets appropriate expectations for the subsequent configuration process

### Integration with Calculator Logic

The component influences the calculator's core functionality by:
   - Setting the initial intent that drives downstream configuration options
   - Potentially loading preset configurations based on selection
   - Establishing the foundation for the personalized calculator experience

## Implementation Details

### Props

- `intent`: String representing the currently selected business priority
- `handleIntentSelect`: Function to update the selected intent
- `resetCalculator`: Function to clear all selections and return to initial state

### External Dependencies

1. **Configuration Data**
   - Imports intent definitions from calculatorConfig.json
   - Accesses preset configurations from calculatorPresets.json
   - Uses consistent data structures for content presentation

2. **Utility Functions**
   - Implements `getDescription()` to retrieve the appropriate description text
   - Prioritizes preset descriptions over default intent descriptions when available

3. **UI Components**
   - Integrates the FeatureIntroduction component for contextual guidance
   - Uses FontAwesome icons for visual reinforcement of concepts

### Rendering Logic

1. **Intent Option Generation**
   - Maps through available intents from configuration
   - Applies conditional styling based on selection state
   - Assigns appropriate icons based on intent type

2. **Ready-Made Solution Identification**
   - Conditionally displays "Ready-Made Solution" badge for appropriate options
   - Creates visual distinction between preset and custom options
   - Uses consistent styling for badge elements

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Decision Simplification**
   - Presents clear, distinct business priorities to choose from
   - Organizes options in a logical, scannable layout
   - Uses descriptive text to help users identify their situation

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Highlights selected option with distinctive styling
   - Uses icons to reinforce the meaning of each option
   - Implements badges to distinguish ready-made solutions

3. **Educational Approach**
   - Includes explanatory text about the benefits of each approach
   - Clarifies the distinction between preset and custom options
   - Sets appropriate expectations for subsequent steps

4. **Reset Pathway**
   - Provides a clear "Start Over" option for users who need to reset
   - Positions the reset control in a non-disruptive but accessible location
   - Uses appropriate visual treatment to distinguish from primary actions

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

1. **Description Fallback**
   - Implements logic to handle missing preset descriptions
   - Falls back to default descriptions when necessary
   - Ensures consistent user experience regardless of data state

2. **Selection State Management**
   - Handles both initial state and subsequent selections
   - Maintains visual consistency across selection states
   - Ensures proper feedback when options are selected

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Rendering**
   - Uses conditional rendering for option-specific elements
   - Implements clean component boundaries for efficient updates
   - Avoids unnecessary calculations or operations

2. **Configuration Loading**
   - Efficiently loads configuration data only when needed
   - Uses static imports for predictable loading behavior
   - Avoids redundant data processing

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Multi-Step Qualification**
   - Expand to a multi-question qualification process for more precise matching
   - Implement branching logic based on previous answers
   - Add progress indicators for multi-step qualification

2. **Enhanced Preset Visualization**
   - Add visual previews of what each preset configuration includes
   - Implement comparison view for different preset options
   - Show outcome previews based on preset selections

3. **Industry-Specific Options**
   - Add industry-specific preset configurations
   - Implement industry selection as part of the qualification process
   - Tailor language and examples to specific industry contexts

4. **User Preference Storage**
   - Add capability to save and recall previous selections
   - Implement user profiles for returning visitors
   - Create shareable configuration links for team collaboration

5. **Hybrid Configuration**
   - Allow users to start with a preset and then customize specific aspects
   - Implement "recommended modifications" for preset configurations
   - Create guided customization paths based on business context
