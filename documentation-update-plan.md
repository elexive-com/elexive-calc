# Elexive Calculator Documentation Update Plan

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of the Elexive Calculator implementation and the current documentation in `elexive-docs/`, there is a significant disconnect between the documented service model and the actual calculator implementation. The documentation describes a **tiered service model** (Standard/Advanced tiers) while the calculator implements a **modular service model** with individual modules, variants, and flexible configuration options.

## Key Discrepancies Identified

### 1. Service Model Architecture
- **Documentation**: Describes two service tiers (Standard/Advanced) with fixed service components
- **Calculator**: Implements a modular system with individual modules that can be mixed and matched
- **Impact**: Complete misalignment between documented service structure and actual offering

### 2. Pricing Structure
- **Documentation**: Tier-based pricing with fixed EVC allocations per service component
- **Calculator**: Module-based pricing with variant-specific EVC values and flexible combinations
- **Impact**: Pricing methodology doesn't match actual calculator logic

### 3. Service Delivery Model
- **Documentation**: Subscription-based with weekly co-creation sessions as primary delivery mechanism
- **Calculator**: Project-based module delivery with completion time estimates and capacity planning
- **Impact**: Fundamental difference in how services are conceptualized and delivered

### 4. Module Structure
- **Documentation**: Limited module descriptions embedded within tier descriptions
- **Calculator**: Comprehensive module catalog with 20+ modules across 5 pillars with detailed specifications
- **Impact**: Documentation severely underrepresents the actual service catalog
