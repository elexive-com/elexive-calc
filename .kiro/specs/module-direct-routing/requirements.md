# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds direct URL routing support for individual modules in the Module Explorer. Users will be able to access specific module detail views via direct URLs using module slugs (e.g., `/modules/foundation-mapping`). Each module in the configuration will have a unique slug identifier derived from its name, and the existing module detail view will be accessible through these direct routes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access specific modules directly via URL, so that I can bookmark, share, or navigate directly to modules of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to `/modules/{slug}` THEN the system SHALL display the module detail view for the corresponding module
2. WHEN a user visits an invalid module slug THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message or redirect to the main modules page
3. WHEN a user shares a module URL THEN the recipient SHALL be able to access the same module detail view directly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each module to have a unique slug identifier, so that the routing system can map URLs to specific modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads module configuration THEN each module SHALL have a unique `id` field containing a URL-safe slug
2. WHEN generating slugs from module names THEN the system SHALL convert names to lowercase and replace spaces with hyphens
3. WHEN multiple modules exist THEN all slug values SHALL be unique across the entire module collection
4. WHEN a module name contains special characters THEN the slug SHALL only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing Module Explorer functionality to remain unchanged, so that my current workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Module Explorer interface THEN all existing functionality SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN clicking "View Details" from the explorer THEN the system SHALL navigate to the direct URL for that module
3. WHEN browsing modules in the explorer THEN the URL SHALL update to reflect the currently viewed module
4. WHEN using browser back/forward buttons THEN navigation SHALL work correctly between module detail views

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the browser URL to reflect the current module being viewed, so that I can use browser navigation features effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a module detail page THEN the browser URL SHALL show `/modules/{slug}`
2. WHEN using browser back button from a module detail view THEN the system SHALL navigate appropriately
3. WHEN refreshing the page on a module detail view THEN the same module SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN the URL changes to a different module slug THEN the corresponding module detail view SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content manager, I want module slugs to be stored in the configuration file, so that I can manage and update them as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating the modulesConfig.json file THEN each module object SHALL include an `id` field with the slug value
2. WHEN adding new modules THEN the `id` field SHALL be manually definable in the configuration
3. WHEN the configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use the `id` field for routing purposes
4. WHEN slug conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and provide clear feedback
