# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current module detail pages provide condensed one-page information about each service module. This specification defines requirements for transforming these pages into comprehensive solution briefs with progressive disclosure, optimized for executive decision-makers. Additionally, the service model will be updated to change "Integrated Execution" from fixed 40 EVC packages to flexible EVC bandwidth options.
