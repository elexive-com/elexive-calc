# Project Intelligence Documentation Guidelines

## Purpose
Project Intelligence serves as living documentation that evolves with the codebase, providing engineers with up-to-date insights about project architecture, patterns, and current status.

## Core Files Structure

### Required Files
- `overview.md` - Project identity, business context, and key objectives
- `architecture.md` - Technical stack, project structure, and deployment details
- `patterns.md` - Development patterns, component architecture, and best practices
- `status.md` - Current development status, recent changes, and performance metrics

### Documentation Standards

#### Content Guidelines
- **Accuracy**: All information must reflect the current state of the codebase
- **Relevance**: Focus on information that helps engineers be productive
- **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language with practical examples
- **Timeliness**: Update documentation when significant changes occur

#### Code Examples
- Include actual code snippets from the project
- Show real patterns used in the codebase
- Provide context for when and why patterns are used
- Keep examples minimal but complete

#### Structure Requirements
- Use consistent markdown formatting
- Include clear section headers
- Provide practical examples and code snippets
- Maintain logical information hierarchy

## Update Triggers

### Mandatory Updates
1. **Major Feature Releases**: New components, routing changes, state management updates
2. **Technology Stack Changes**: Framework upgrades, new dependencies, build tool changes
3. **Architecture Modifications**: New patterns, refactoring, performance optimizations
4. **Deployment Changes**: Environment updates, CI/CD modifications

### Update Process
1. **Analysis**: Review recent commits and changes
2. **Documentation**: Update relevant sections with current information
3. **Validation**: Ensure all code examples work and reflect current patterns
4. **Review**: Check for accuracy and completeness
